1)What could be the vehicle Computational power?
In MARINA’s model, a vehicle is assumed to contribute only a small compute slice (≈1 MIPS CPU and 1 MB storage unit). 
Individually, this is limited, but when many vehicles form a vehicular cloud, their aggregated resources become sufficient for running lightweight edge tasks and reducing reliance on base stations.

2)How vehicle can be an edge?
Modern vehicles already host powerful onboard units (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon Ride, Tesla FSD chips) capable of tens to hundreds of TOPS for ADAS and AI tasks.
These resources can be partially shared for VEC, letting vehicles run lightweight tasks, preprocess sensor data, or cache content. 
In MARINA, such vehicles act as edge nodes, and when pooled into a vehicular cloud, they provide meaningful compute power.

3)How will u handle interoperability across various regions?
Use standardized APIs/middleware (ETSI MEC, MQTT, DDS) so regional VEC controllers can coordinate. 
In remote/low-connectivity areas, rely on local processing, store-and-forward, and V2V relaying until reconnection is possible.

4)How will u schedule tasks if vehicles are highly mobile and unpredictable?
MARINA tackles this by using an LSTM-based mobility prediction model to forecast whether a vehicle or RSU will remain available during task execution. 
This prediction feeds into the scheduler, helping it avoid assigning tasks to nodes that may soon disconnect, ensuring more reliable execution.
